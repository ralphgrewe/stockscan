## Font Setup for PDF Reports

This project generates PDF reports using DejaVu fonts. After cloning the repository, you must download the required font files.

**To download and extract the fonts, run:**
```bash
bash scripts/download_fonts.sh
```

This will download and extract the DejaVu fonts into the correct directory for PDF generation.
